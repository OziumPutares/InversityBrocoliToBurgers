# Script 
My name is Eugeniusz Lewandowski, This is my INversity Brocoli To Brugers pitch I think that the main reason for obesity is the ease of access to junk food like burgers however this requires major legislation in order to control. Another **major** factor in obesity and the large consupmtion of junk food is the temptation casused by adverts. Since people spend more and more time online, a new major factor in the mass purchasing of junk food is the targeted and untargeted food __adviertisement__ of junk food with discounts, maikng the junk more financially attractive; ease of purchase, with advertising links directly leading to a one or two click purchase; and most importantly the constant cues, through the advertisements leading to the constant entrenching of the already developed habits. In order to prevent these advertisements I decided to create a custom adblocker variant that only blocks advertisements and attempts to reduce the collection of third party cookies by preventing the accessing of well known tracking food links.
