Hi, my name is Eugeniusz Lewandowski, and this is my "Broccoli to Burgers" pitch for Inversity.
Today, I will be introducing you to my solution, Ad&ObesityBlocker.

Obesity has many causes, but one of the primary ones is the easy access to junk food like burgers. However, tackling this issue would require major legislation, which is beyond my current scope.
Another key factor is the temptation created by the taste of junk food itself.
But perhaps the most significant and often overlooked factor is the power of advertising—specifically, how junk food ads manipulate consumer behavior.

These ads, powered by sophisticated algorithms based on user behavior, play a massive role in influencing people's decisions.
After conducting surveys and questionnaires, I discovered that around 33% of respondents initially believed ads were to blame for their junk food consumption.
When presented with additional facts, this number jumped to 84%.
This finding is supported by research showing that children consumed 45% more food when exposed to food advertising and that advertising can trigger automatic eating behaviors.

As people spend more and more time online, the role of food advertisements in driving unhealthy eating habits has only increased.
The constant barrage of junk food ads, often featuring discounts, makes unhealthy options more financially attractive.
These ads are designed for ease of purchase, leading consumers directly to a one- or two-click buying process.
More critically, the constant exposure to such ads reinforces unhealthy eating habits over time.

That’s where my solution, Ad&ObesityBlocker, comes in.
As the name suggests, it blocks food-related advertisements, particularly from major junk food chains like McDonald's and KFC.
By blocking these ads, we can help protect vulnerable users from being targeted by companies promoting unhealthy food options.

This is achieved by leveraging the well-known EasyList filter and adding custom filters chosen by the user,
allowing for highly customizable and fine-grained control over the types of content they wish to block.
In summary, Ad&ObesityBlocker aims to address the impact of junk food advertising on obesity by putting the power back into the hands of users.o
